            Hi, my name is Sam Sindt. I'm a computer science student in my senior year. I also consider myself a software engineer. I have worked as to be a software engineer on an internship at Atlassian and on open-source projects.

            This blog is a place where I will share my thoughts about technology, software development, my experience as a computer science student, and anything else that I find useful to write down.
